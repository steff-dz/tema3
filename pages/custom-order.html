    <p id="orderGuide">Ordering custom furniture is expensive, so if you don't got the big bills to pay up, go away! It takes lots of time for great craftsmanship. plus wood is hella expensive. So, if you don't have the $$$ for that, save us some time and just go to Ikea. But if you do have the monies and want something that will last more than a few years, step right up! I can also make anything you want; game table, edgy night stand, a bookshelf to suit your exact dreams and desires? You want it, you got it (just remember it's hella expensive. For real.)</p>
